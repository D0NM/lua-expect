====

Lua Expect provides `Expect`(a tool for automating interactive applications)
support for Lua.


### Build
```
cmake . && make
```


### Demo
There is a demo script `ssh_expect.lua` in the `tests` folder, you can simply
modify it, then use `LuaJit` or `Lua(v5.1)` to run it and see what happens :).
